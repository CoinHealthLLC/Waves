```

 Type in the asset ID (shown above) into one of the boxes on the screen. At that point there should be a drop-down which appears. Select the asset ID from the drop-down and it should populate in the text field.

 Please note, sometimes clicking on the dropdown cause it to close before the actual item was selected. If this happens just try again and it should work but you can always refresh your browser if the trouble persists.
