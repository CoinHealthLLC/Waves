## Once you click the button you will be shown some works in the SEED box as shown. Yes, if you decide to steal the .00000587 Waves currently in this now comprimised account you have the ability to do so. The lesson here is DONT GIVE YOUR SEED PHRASE TO ANYONE. Instead, copy this SEED phrase and go back to the new waves wallet page.
